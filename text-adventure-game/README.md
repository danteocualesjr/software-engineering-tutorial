# Text Adventure Game - Software Engineering Tutorial

Welcome! You'll build a text adventure game while learning Software Engineering.

## How to Use
1. Open files in order (room.py → item.py → player.py → game_engine.py)
2. **Type the code yourself** - don't copy/paste!
3. Use Cursor's **Tab** feature to auto-complete
4. Read comments to understand concepts
5. Complete all TODO items

## Learning Path
- **room.py**: Classes, attributes, methods
- **item.py**: More OOP, relationships between objects
- **player.py**: State management, collections
- **game_engine.py**: Game loops, control flow, error handling
- **commands.py**: String parsing, command pattern

## Running the Game
```bash
python main.py
```

## What to Do First
1. Open `game/room.py`
2. Start typing the code where you see `# TODO:` comments
3. Use Tab to autocomplete as you type
4. Complete each TODO before moving to the next file
